  - [Français](https://www.hydroquebec.com/residentiel/mieux-consommer/offres-pour-economiser-cet-hiver/index.html)

- This integration uses Hydro-Québec Open Data to provide peak event information and helps you prepare and optimize your energy usage during these times.

## Configuration

- When adding the Hydro-Peak integration to Home Assistant, you will need to know your rate plan offer. For example:
  - **Flex-D**: Your offer is `TPC-DPC`
  - **Winter Credit**: Your offer is `CPC-D`

- You can configure the integration directly within Home Assistant to align with your specific rate plan and needs.

## Automations

A blueprint is a template that simplifies the process of creating automations by providing pre-configured settings and triggers. 
Using these blueprints, you can quickly set up automations  to Hydro-Peak.
